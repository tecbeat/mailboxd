// Event bus extension point.
//
// Community edition: NoopEventBus — all events are discarded.
// Pro edition: AuditEventBus — events are persisted to audit database.
// Enterprise edition: adds SIEM webhook to the same trait impl.
//

// It never reads from the event bus — events are fire-and-forget.
